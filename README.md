# jokes-app
Spring Web Application

This project uses a dependency created by the spring boot guru. The dependency holds an array of chuck norris jokes and I used that array to generate a random jokes application.
The joke is chosen at random by a service layer that has the functionality to access the list of jokes in a random fashion. The controller then picks up the information that the service layer has produced and then renders it to the front-end using thymeleaf.

This contains:

Java
HTML
CSS

With the support of:
Spring Web
Thymeleaf

You can view the web page by visiting: http://localhost:8080/  
Note: The data and css won't be rendered by opening up the HTML file alone. The application needs to be run first!
